Application Design Patterns Project - Movie Fight

About: a movie fight app that compares movie stats and shows a winner. a green stat box indicates a win a yellow stat box indicates a loss. 

instructions:
user types in two movies to be compared. once they search some information about the movies will be displayed.

 what I learned:
 creating re usable functions to be used in other projects. for instance inside autocomplete.js and utils.js there are functions that can either be used for other projects or used uniquely multiple times in a project.
